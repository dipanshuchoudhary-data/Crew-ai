IMPROVED EMAIL:
Subject: Request for change in class schedule on Monday, February 24

Dear Ayush,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend the Java and Advanced Web Technology class scheduled from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM on Monday, February 24th. I have an emergency situation that requires my immediate attention and I will have to leave for home.

I would appreciate it if you could kindly reschedule my attendance for the class to a slot that is more convenient for me, specifically from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM as it is currently free in my schedule.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I am looking forward to your positive response.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best Regards,

Dipanshu
